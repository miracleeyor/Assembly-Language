#This is a MIPS program to print first n numbers fo the fibonacci sequence. n will be user input. 
#As the first two number of the sequence are given (0 and 1), n must be >=3
#Two restrictions: 
#$s0 must store the value of n in the main program. 
#$s0 must also be used as the register for storing the temporary/local result of the addition in the procedure
